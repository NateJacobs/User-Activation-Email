# User Activation Email #

**Contributors:** NateJacobs   
**Tags:** user, registration, activation, email  
**Requires at least:** 3.1  
**Tested up to:** 3.5  
**Stable tag:** 1.0  

Require users to enter an activation code to access the site the first time. The activation code is emailed upon user registration.

## Description ##

Adds an activation code to the new user email sent once a user registers. The user must enter this activation code in addition to a username and password to log in successfully the first time. A 10 character activation code is added to the user meta when the user is registered.

The administrator may reset the activation code or enter a new one from the users profile page.

This plugin does not currently work with multi-site. Multi-site uses an activation key system for new registrations already.

## Installation ##

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
