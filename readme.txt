Tags: user, registration, activation, email
Requires at least: 3.5
Tested up to: 4.1
Stable tag: 1.3.0

Require users to enter an activation code to access the site the first time. The activation code is emailed upon user registration.

== Description ==

Adds an activation code to the new user email sent once a user registers. The user must enter this activation code in addition to a username and password to log in successfully the first time. A 10 character activation code is added to the user meta when the user is registered.

The administrator may reset the activation code or enter a new one from the users profile page.

This plugin does not currently work with multi-site. Multi-site uses an activation key system for new registrations already.
